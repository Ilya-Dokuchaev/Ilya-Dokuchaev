### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ilya Dokuchaev a junior frontend developer. I can work with multi-tasking, under pressure, being able to find a solution in no time, get things rolling and after that take the responsibility of my decisions.This is the way.

I always give myself feedback when the job is done. From my perspective it helps to find solutions for similar tasks even better and quicker. 

As for me frontend is a whole new world of cool things I can do myself.

You can see all of my pet-projects on my github account.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool React-projects
